# SCJJ2
Second game made with Godot 3.2  
Godot can be found [here](https://godotengine.org/)  
Godot is pretty powerful and getting better with each release.  
You can export your projects to Winblowz, MacOSX, Crapple, Android, and HTML5!  
After my first game I would like to put some lessons learned into action.
